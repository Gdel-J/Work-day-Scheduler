## Credits

Created by GÃ©rard DEL VECCHIO with a starter code ( html and css files)  during my UCF coding bootcamp. 
I had help  with  TA Andres Jimenez during a tutoring session to start the script file. I could ask questions to the TA's in office hours. I also  reviewed my bootcamp courses, read  from differents ressources and watched online videos.
